Waterfall animated texture(s)
*****************************

By Dieter Marfurt, 2022

This asset consists of 2 animations:

-11 frames of seamless looping waterfall jpgs meant to be add-blended.
-6  frames of seamless looping concentric waves that alpha-fade to transparent. (Try Add or Alpha) This is for
    below the waterfall, and I'd suggest to add some particle emitter there, so I'm providing a foamy particle png too.

As well as a mesh in B3D format that has the shape of the waterfall, to be used for the waterfall texture and for the rock
behind it as well, using waterfall_behind.png as alpha-blended texture, so the top edge is masked correctly.

NOTE!

This animation was extracted from a GIF animation found on 77 GIF sharing platforms, of which the earliest dates back to
2013 on tumblr, where further traces to the original author vanish. The exact copyright status can only be assumed to be
in the public domain, but no guarantee is given.

However, if you give nice credit to the unknown, original author, he/she may be proud.
You may or may not give me credit too, for extracting, masking and making it game-ready.
